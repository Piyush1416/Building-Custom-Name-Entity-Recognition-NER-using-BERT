# Building-Custom-Name-Entity-Recognition-NER-using-BERT

Hi all, for the given task I will be designing my notebook into following sections:

## 1.Introduction

   A.Task
   B.Dataset
  
## 2.Load packages, data and conduct initial EDA

## 3.Try Building and Fine Tuning own BERT model using Transformers

  A.Prepare the sentences and labels for fine tuning
  B.FIT BERT for Name Entity Recognition
  C.Visualise the training loss
  D.Apply the model on new sentence
  E.Testing on test data
  F.Evaluation

## 4.Achieve same using Simple Transformer package

  A.Configure model
  B.Training our model
  C.Predict Results on Test data
  D.Evaluation
  
## 5.Lessons Learnt and Potential Improvements

## 6.Learning Resources
